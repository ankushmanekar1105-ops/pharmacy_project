# Pharmacy Website – Version 1 → Version 2

This project demonstrates my frontend development learning journey using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

Instead of building a static website and stopping there, I improved the project by restructuring the layout, refining the UI, and adding interactive functionality.
